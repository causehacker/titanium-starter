Why
------

Why Not?

After launching a few apps to the App Store with Titanium, I found myself running accross the same quirks, code base, functions, and image dimensions, etc. The quicker I can start up an app build, I'm confident it will help me commit to it and ship it. 

This is the base I use now, and will continue to update it as I find the need.
